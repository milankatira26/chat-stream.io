## backend  flow 


- need to create a customer with id name and imageurl


id should be uniq so we can follow like 
- `milan-k-cu-12` for customer
- `milan-k-se-12` for sp






### channel mechanism 

- we need to create channel for new chat between sp and cu 
- we can use booking id as uniq id for channel 
- code link for that [https://chat.openai.com/share/b820958c-0a24-43f8-a5c2-e7343df0b6b2](https://chat.openai.com/share/b820958c-0a24-43f8-a5c2-e7343df0b6b2) 


once we click on chat from frontend we need a channel info from backend
